To do this, we set out to create memorable and playful experiences that would build love and drive awareness.",

The process was highly collaborative, with both Droga5 and Resn bringing ideas to the table. We chose our nine favourites and began a covert operation to insert them into wildly disparate areas of popular culture—and having a lot of fun doing so!"]

WhaleSynth was a captivating digital whale noise synthesizer - was so good Brian Eno even tweeted about it. NailChamp started as a joke of having nail artists compete -turns out they were a thing and it the competition got serious!", "We created promotional sites for two products that you could actually buy, FailChips (because everyone knows the broken chips at the bottom of the bag are the tastiest) and SnailPrimp (a beauty treatment made from the secretions of real snails). We made the MaleCrimp Tumblr site (another one I worked on), which kicked off an unexpected fashion trend.

The public response was overwhelmingly positive, from across the cultural spectrum. For us, it was exciting to watch people connect the dots and find their way to MailChimp, in surprising ways.

This discovery-led phase included detailed technical prototyping, animatic storyboards and animation previs. Our solution demonstrated that we could create an experience that captured the exhilaration of driving a real Mustang.", "A Ford Mustang is built for performance and Pocket Mustang is no different. During the development phase, we refined our motion analysis system to achieve the highest level of sensitivity and accuracy possible. Eventually, our system could recognize over 300 different phone movements. We also brought in the Resn AI Video Editor (RAVE), for Pocket Mustang’s final reveal. We optimized RAVE to automatically select the best shots and angles for rhythm and timing. To bring customizable elements into the video, we used our interactive content platform, Cake. Cake features a dynamic rendering process that can bring an audience deeper into a story, by adding extra layers of interaction and personalized content."]
